## A Foreword

Good my lord, or gentle traveller, whosoever hath by fortune or providence arrived upon this humble repository, I bid thee welcome.

Herein are gathered the dotfiles appertaining unto mine own **Hyprland Material Me** configuration. Though I make no bold claim that it surpasseth all others in beauty or craft, yet I confess that I hold it in no small esteem, for much labour and many an idle hour have been spent in its fashioning.

This collection containeth not the whole of my configuration, for certain pieces remain beyond its bounds. Nevertheless, it doth include the greater part of that whereupon the eye most commonly resteth, namely:

* **Hyprland**
* **Waybar**
* **SwayOSD**
* **Mako**
* **Wofi**
* **Wlogout**
* **Zen Browser**

The style thereof beareth some likeness unto **Google Material Design**, from whence the name *Material Me* doth spring. Yet this resemblance was not first conceived by deliberate design, but rather came to pass little by little whilst I adorned and refined the countenance of Waybar.



## Of Those Things Required

Before these dotfiles may serve thee faithfully, thou must first ensure that certain programs and utilities be present upon thy system. Lacking these, divers portions of the configuration may fail to appear or behave as intended.

Amongst them are:

- **Hyprland**
- **Hymission** Hyprland extension
- **Waybar**
- **SwayOSD**
- **Mako**
- **Wofi**
- **Wlogout**
- **awww**
- **Waypaper**
- **Matugen**
- **Kitty**
- **Rofimoji**
- **Cliphist**
- **KDE Plasma**
- **Jetbrains Mono NFP** (For the proper rendering icons)
- **Bibata-Modern-Classic** (Cursor)
- Any further utilities whereupon any of these utilities may depend.

Should any be absent, thy package manager shall readily furnish them, though the manner thereof differeth according to the distribution thou dost employ.


## Of the Installation Thereof

Shouldst thou desire to make these dotfiles thine own, thou mayest proceed in the following wise.

1. First, ensure that all the dependencies aforelisted have been installed upon thy system. Should any be lacking, consult the package manager proper to thy distribution and procure them accordingly.

2. Thereafter, obtain this repository by cloning it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XxsansxV/Material-Me.git
   ```

3. Copy such files as thou desirest into thy home directory, taking care not to overwrite aught of value unless thou hast first made due provision by way of a backup.

4. Amend those portions of the configuration that are peculiar unto thine own machine. Most especially shouldst thou examine **.config/hypr/confd/monitors.lua**, together with **.config/waypaper/config.ini**, for these contain settings ordained for mine own hardware and therefore may not accord with thine.

5. Once these matters have been attended unto, either begin a fresh Hyprland session or reload the affected components, and the configuration should thereafter present itself in its intended form.

Should any part thereof fail to behave as expected, be not overmuch dismayed. Dotfiles are creatures of many habits, and each system hath customs of its own. A small measure of adjustment is oft required before all things dwell together in harmony.

## A Necessary Admonition

Take heed before thou proceedest.

These dotfiles were devised and tested upon a Laptop's **CachyOS** installation wherein both **Hyprland** and **KDE Plasma** were present. Though Hyprland be the compositor for which this configuration was chiefly fashioned, certain portions thereof do nevertheless lean upon the presence of KDE Plasma.

Most notable amongst these are Waybar modules that make use of **kcm_shell6**, together with sundry commands (such as those executed by **Waypaper**(plasma-apply-colorscheme) after the generation of a new colour scheme) which invoke KDE utilities.

Should thy system lack KDE Plasma, these components must either be altered to employ suitable alternatives or removed altogether. Failing this, thou mayest find that certain features refuse to function, whilst others may occasion errors or break entirely.

In brief: these dotfiles are best enjoyed upon a system where both **Hyprland** and **KDE Plasma** are installed. Those who venture otherwise should be prepared to adapt the configuration to the customs of their own environment.

## If Thou Wouldst Make Use Thereof

Should it please thee to fork this repository, to borrow from it, or to fashion it anew according to thine own liking, thou hast my leave, and I shall raise no objection.

Yet be thou warned that certain parameters are written expressly for mine own machine. Most notable amongst these are those found within **.config/hypr/confd/monitors.lua** and **.config/waypaper/config.ini**, and therefore they must be amended to accord with the order of thine own system, lest confusion and mischief ensue.

## A Final Benediction

Take whatever thou wilt. Build upon it. Improve it. Make it thine own. I ask only that my name remain where these labours first began.

If these humble dotfiles should lighten thy labours, stir thy curiosity, or serve as the foundation of some greater work, then I shall reckon their publication well worthwhile.

Now go thy way in peace. May thy compositor remain steadfast, thy frame-rate unwavering, thy configuration free of error, and thy rice ever worthy of admiration.

Godspeed.
